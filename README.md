# Transformers Projects

This repository contains custom implementations of transformer models applied to various tasks, including neural machine translation and image classification.


## Introduction

Transformers have significantly advanced the field of machine learning, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. This repository demonstrates custom-built transformer models applied to:

- **Neural Machine Translation:** Translating text from English to Turkish using a dataset of over 100,000 lines.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT) Classifier:** Classifying images using the Vision Transformer architecture.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **`Transformers_libs.py`**: Contains the custom transformer implementation and utility functions.
- **`eng-tr-neural-translation-dive-into-transformers.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook detailing the neural machine translation project.
- **`vit-example.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the Vision Transformer classifier.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berfinduman/transformers-projects.git
   cd transformers-projects

## Projects
Neural Machine Translation
This project involves translating English text to Turkish using a custom transformer model. The dataset comprises over 100,000 lines of parallel text. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Vision Transformer (ViT) Classifier
This project demonstrates the application of the Vision Transformer architecture for image classification tasks. The notebook includes data preparation, model implementation, training, and performance assessment.
